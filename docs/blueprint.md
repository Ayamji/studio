# **App Name**: ML Navigator

## Core Features:

- Interactive Navigation: Interactive landing page with clear navigation to Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning sections.
- Learning Modules: Dedicated sections for Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning, each explaining definitions, types, and relevant models.
- Glossary: Glossary section to define common ML terms.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming blue (#3498db) to represent knowledge and stability.
- Secondary color: A clean white (#ffffff) for readability and clarity.
- Accent: A vibrant green (#2ecc71) for calls to action and interactive elements.
- Use a clean, modern layout with clear sectioning for each ML topic.
- Consistent and simple icons to represent each learning module and model.
